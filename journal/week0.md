All these Individual tasks will be discussed below. I will state my process of completing the task, add screenshot proofs and give details about some issues I came across and how I debugged these issues for tasks that requires these information.

### âœ… Set up 2 AWS Budget

For this task I created 2 separate Budgets, one for Credits use and the other was created using the CLI and covers all forms of spending.

#### Issues and Fixes
For this task I ran through some Issue
- First Issue was that the terminal wis giving me the wrong outputs after running `aws budgets create-budget`. I solved this issue by correctly naming my `budget-notifiactions-with-subscriber.json` file.
- After solving the first Issue I was still reciving the wrong out put from the terminal, after looking at the error, I found out that I hadn't properly exported my `ACCOUNT_ID` to an environment variable. I solved this issue by running the command `export ACCOUNT_ID = $(aws sts get-caller-identiy --query Account --output text)`

### âœ… Used the CLI from Gitpod to create a Budget and a Billing Alarm

- Created an sns topic from the CLI using gitpod with the command `aws sns create-topic --name CLI-generated-billing-alarm`

**Proof is in the commits made to the code ðŸš€**

#### Issues and Fixes
For this task I had the issue of using the wrong region for creating my SNS topic. I created the SNS topic in US-East-1 region and was using it for my EventBridge Notification in the EU-Central-1 region. Took me some time to figure out my mistake.
***Learnt from this issue that I should always be aware of the region I am using to create a service.***
