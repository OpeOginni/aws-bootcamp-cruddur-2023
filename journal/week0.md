### âœ… Set up MFA for Root Account and create IAM role

- Added MFA for my Root Account using Authy
- Created new User and added that user to an 'admin' user group
- Added MFA for my new 'admin' user

For this task I created 2 separate Budgets, one for Credits use and the other was created using the CLI and covers all forms of spending.

#### Bugs and Fixes
For this task I ran through some bugs
- First bug was that the terminal wis giving me the wrong outputs after running `aws budgets create-budget`. I solved this bug by correctly naming my `budget-notifiactions-with-subscriber.json` file.
- After solving this bug I was still reciving the wrong out put from the terminal, after looking at the error, I found out that I hadn't properly exported my `ACCOUNT_ID` to an environment variable. I solved this bug by running the command `export ACCOUNT_ID = $(aws sts get-caller-identiy --query Account --output text)`

### âœ… Used the CLI from Gitpod to create a Budget and a Billing Alarm

- Created an sns topic from the CLI using gitpod with the command `aws sns create-topic --name CLI-generated-billing-alarm`

**Proof is in the commits made to the code ðŸš€**

- **SNS Confirmation**
