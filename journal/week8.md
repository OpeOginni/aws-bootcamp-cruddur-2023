### ✅ Implemented CDK Stack

Watched the week 8 - Serverless Image Processing live session, and got to learn about the AWS SDK. I statred making little reaserch on what processes I can implement using the SDK. I also came accross this GitHub Account by AWS called [**AWS samples**](https://github.com/aws-samples) where is a Repo with lot of examples on how to use the CDK, I plan to use this repo for my personal projects and to learn more. I really enjoy using the Typescript languge. Here is a link to all CDK samples provided in TypeScript [**AWS-CDK-Examples**](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-cdk-examples/tree/master/typescript)
